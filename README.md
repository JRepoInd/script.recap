The Recap addon is an addon that allows you to "Catch Up" with what has happened in a given TV Episode. It uses the site [www.recapguide.com](http://www.recapguide.com/) and will display a small description and 50 images to jog your memory for what happened.

This is useful if you watch TV in a similar manner to me, I generally record an entire season/series and then watch the episodes back-to-back. (I also delete episodes once I have watched them). This means it can be almost a year between watching each season/series, and this addon can help remind you what has happened.

Please give it a go, and feel free to post any suggestions/issues. It can be run from the Programs section, or call up the context menu on a TV Show/Season/Episode and you can get the recap on that show (For episodes, there is also an option to get a recap for the previous episode)
